# Testing and Validation Standards

## File Validation
- Validate XML structure: `xmllint --noout filename`
- Check property list format: `plutil -lint filename`
- Verify file encoding: `file filename` (should show UTF-8)
- Test Gatekeeper compatibility: `spctl -a -v filename`
- Check extended attributes: `xattr -l filename`
- Verify file permissions: `ls -la filename` (should be 644)

## Installation Testing
- Test in multiple applications (TextEdit, Terminal, Browser, Word)
- Verify character output accuracy for all mapped keys
- Test input source switching between layouts
- Validate system integration after restart
- Test with different keyboard types (built-in, external, wireless)

## Security Testing
- Test Gatekeeper bypass methods
- Verify quarantine attribute removal
- Test code signing if implemented
- Validate security settings don't interfere

## Documentation Testing
- Verify all links work correctly
- Test installation instructions step-by-step
- Validate troubleshooting steps
- Check code examples for accuracy
- Test diagnostic commands

## System Compatibility
- Test on different macOS versions (minimum macOS 10.15)
- Verify with different keyboard types
- Test with various applications (native and third-party)
- Validate security settings (SIP, Gatekeeper)
- Test with different user accounts
