# Project Development History

## Overview
This document captures the complete development journey of the Custom Japanese Input Source project, including all approaches tried, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Concept and Research
**Goal**: Create a custom input source for direct Hiragana typing on mechanical keyboards

**Approaches Considered:**
1. **macOS Keyboard Layout (.keylayout)** - ✅ **CHOSEN APPROACH**
   - Native macOS support
   - Direct character mapping
   - No IME dependency
   - System-level integration

2. **Alternative Approaches Considered:**
   - Custom IME development (too complex)
   - Third-party input method software (dependency issues)
   - Hardware-level key remapping (limited functionality)

### Phase 2: Implementation Strategy
**Technical Approach**: XML-based keyboard layout following Apple's DTD

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Layout ID**: 9999 (custom, avoids system conflicts)
- **Character Mapping**: Direct QWERTY-to-Hiragana mapping
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 for proper Japanese character support
- **Structure**: ANSI layout for standard US keyboards

### Phase 3: Development Process

#### 3.1 Initial Layout Creation
**Challenges Encountered:**
- Understanding macOS keyboard layout XML structure
- Mapping QWERTY keys to appropriate Hiragana characters
- Ensuring proper Unicode encoding
- Following Apple's DTD requirements

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Studied existing keyboard layouts for reference
- Created logical character mapping strategy
- Used proper XML structure with keyMapSet and keyMap
- Implemented UTF-8 encoding for Japanese characters

#### 3.2 Character Mapping Strategy
**Mapping Philosophy:**
- **Vowels**: A=あ, I=い, U=う, E=え, O=お (intuitive placement)
- **Consonants**: Logical grouping by sound families
- **Special Characters**: ん (n) as standalone consonant
- **Punctuation**: Japanese quotation marks 「」for bracket keys

**Complete Character Set Mapped:**
- All 46 basic Hiragana characters
- Number row (0-9) mapped to Hiragana
- Special characters and punctuation
- Standard keys (space, enter, backspace, tab)

#### 3.3 Technical Implementation Details
**XML Structure:**
```xml
<keyboard group="0" id="9999" name="HiraganaLaser" maxout="1">
    <layouts>
        <layout first="0" last="0" mapSet="ANSI" modifiers="modifierMap0"/>
    </layouts>
    <modifierMap id="modifierMap0" defaultIndex="0">
        <keyMapSelect mapIndex="0">
            <modifier keys=""/>
        </keyMapSelect>
    </modifierMap>
    <keyMapSet id="ANSI">
        <keyMap index="0">
            <!-- Key mappings here -->
        </keyMap>
    </keyMapSet>
</keyboard>
```

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing

#### 4.1 Documentation Development
**Documentation Created:**
- Comprehensive README.md with installation instructions
- Complete key mapping tables
- Technical specifications
- Future enhancement roadmap

**Documentation Challenges:**
- Initially missing number row documentation
- Need for clear installation instructions
- Technical detail level for users

**Solutions:**
- Added separate sections for number row and letter rows
- Step-by-step installation guide
- Technical details section for developers

#### 4.2 Testing and Validation
**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing of character output
- Verification of XML structure validity
- Installation testing on macOS
- Key mapping verification

**Issues Identified:**
- Need for system restart after installation
- Input source selection process
- Character encoding verification

### Phase 5: Repository Management

#### 5.1 GitHub Integration
**Repository Setup:**
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/ScizorsBLBC/Custom-Input-Source.git
- Initial commit with basic files
- License: CC0-1.0 (Public Domain)
- Proper .gitignore for macOS development

**Version Control Process:**
- Initial commit with keyboard layout
- Documentation updates
- README improvements
- Merge with existing LICENSE file

#### 5.2 Project Structure
**Final File Structure:**
```
/Users/scizors/Library/Keyboard Layouts/
├── HiraganaLaser.keylayout    # Main keyboard layout file
├── README.md                   # Comprehensive documentation
├── PROJECT_HISTORY.md         # This development history
├── .gitignore                  # Git ignore rules
└── LICENSE                     # CC0-1.0 license
```

### Phase 6: Current Status and Future Development

#### 6.1 Completed Features
✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Complete Hiragana character set (46 characters)
- Number row mapping (0-9)
- Proper XML structure following Apple standards
- UTF-8 encoding for Japanese characters
- Installation documentation
- GitHub repository with version control

#### 6.2 Current Limitations
**Known Limitations:**
- No Dakuon/Han-dakuon support (が, ざ, だ, ば, ぱ)
- No small character support (っ, ゃ, ゅ, ょ)
- No Katakana layout (There will be a katakana keyboard input added as well for learning purposes on a custom keyboard siilar to this in the future)
- Basic modifier key support only
- No installation automation

#### 6.3 Future Development Roadmap
**Phase 1 Enhancements:**
- Add Dakuon/Han-dakuon characters using modifier keys
- Implement small character support
- Create Katakana layout variant

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- Advanced modifier key combinations
- Installation script automation
- User customization options
- Performance optimization

**Phase 3 Enhancements:**
- Multiple layout variants
- Advanced character combinations
- Integration with other input methods
- Cross-platform considerations

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Keyboard Layout File**: XML-based mapping system
2. **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 for Japanese characters
3. **System Integration**: Native macOS input source
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and developer guides

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Direct Character Output**: Bypasses IME for immediate Hiragana output
- **QWERTY Preservation**: Maintains familiar keyboard layout
- **System Compatibility**: Uses standard macOS keyboard layout system
- **Unicode Support**: Full Japanese character set support

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **XML-based approach**: Leveraged existing macOS infrastructure
2. **Direct character mapping**: Eliminated IME complexity
3. **Logical character placement**: Intuitive QWERTY-to-Hiragana mapping
4. **Comprehensive documentation**: Clear installation and usage instructions

### Challenges Overcome
1. **XML Structure**: Learned macOS keyboard layout DTD requirements
2. **Character Encoding**: Ensured proper UTF-8 support
3. **Documentation**: Initially missed number row, corrected with comprehensive tables
4. **Repository Setup**: Merged with existing GitHub repository

### Best Practices Established
1. **Version Control**: Proper git workflow with meaningful commit messages
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with technical details
3. **Testing**: Manual verification of all character mappings
4. **Structure**: Clean project organization with proper file naming
